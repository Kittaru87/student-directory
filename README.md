# Student Directory #

A ruby-based command line student directory script that allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy

## Features ##

* User input
* Student list displays in a number of different ways
* Ability to save and load previous lists
* Correcting input error

This app will run through the command line or terminal. It will automatically try to upload student data from *students.csv* - you should create this file in your local project directory to save your student list into.
